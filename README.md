# 01 HTML, CSS, and Git: Code Refactor

## Description

To update a set of starter code and refactor it (restructuring without changing the functionality) to make an existing site more accessible. The goal is to make the website more accessible for people with disabilities and those needing screen readers and/or braille keyboards. This also helps companies avoid litigation when people with disabilities cannot access their website.

Refactoring also affects SEO performance. Websites with bad code can hinder user experience and negatively influence SEO rankings.
